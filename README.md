# FuscoLog
Making a new running log web app for the team (fuck Strava, respectfully). Hoping to be fully completed by March 2022, with a coaches dashboard and training group features.

To see current progress and run the development server, clone the repo and navigate into the 'fusco-log' folder. Run 'npm install' and then 'npm start' and you should be all set.
